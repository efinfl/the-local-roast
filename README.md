This is a redo of an old project (Not Starbucks) that I collaborated on while attending the UCF Coding Bootcamp. The original was a `JQuery` application for which I wrote most of the logic. So, decided to redo it in `React` for fun -- working on it, of and on, time permits.

Like its predecessor, it uses  `geolocation` and `Foursquare API` to find local coffee shops near the user.
